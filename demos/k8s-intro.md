# Demo - Introduction to Kubernetes

## Create a cluster

~~~sh
# create a resource group
az group create -n mycluster -l northeurope

# create the k8s cluster in this group
az acs create -g mycluster -n mycluster --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -t kubernetes

# show that context is not there yet
kubectl config get-contexts     # "mycluster" does not show up

# import credentials to kubectl client
az acs kubernetes get-credentials -n ccdemo -g ccdemo
kubectl config get-context      # "mycluster" context is added
kubectl get nodes               # shows cluster nodes
~~~

## Create a pod on the cluster

Create a yaml file `mywebserver-pod.yaml` with the following contents:

~~~yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mywebserver
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:                  # alternatively, use the image which was
  - name: nginx                # provisioned to docker hub in the prev demo
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
~~~

Now deploy this pod resource onto the cluster:

~~~sh
# create the pod
kubectl create -f mywebserver-pod.yaml

# list the pod
kubectl get pods

# where does it run?
kubectl describe pod mywebserver
~~~

To show that there's a real docker container running somewhere on a node, we can track it down on the cluster:

~~~sh
ssh -A azureuser@[address-or-name-of-master]
> ssh azureuser@[address-or-name-of-node-where-pod-is-running]
> docker ps                    # we can see that our "mywebserver" container is running
> exit
> exit
~~~

How can we access the web server content now?  The port is _not_ exposed in any way, so one way would be to go into the container itself:

~~~sh
# run a new command inside of our "mywebserver" pod
kubectl exec -ti mywebserver /bin/bash
# install curl if needed: apt-get update and apt-get install curl
> curl localhost                # we see our webserver answering
~~~

Alternatively, we can just use port-forwarding to our local machine for convenience:

~~~sh
kubectl port-forward mywebserver 8080:80

# from local machine:
curl localhost:8080             # we see our webserver answering
~~~

## Creating a deployment of pods onto the cluster

Create a yaml file `mywebserver-deployment.yaml` with the following contents:

~~~yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: mywebserverdeployment
    namespace: default
spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: myapp
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: myapp
                tier: data
        spec:
            containers:
            - name: nginx
              image: nginx
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: 100m
                  memory: 200Mi
              ports:
              - containerPort: 80
~~~

Now create the deployment on the cluster:

~~~sh
kubectl delete pod mywebserver                 # delete the single pod
kubectl get pods                               # show that there's no pods
kubectl create -f mywebserver-deployment.yaml  # create the deployment
kubectl get deployment -o wide                 # show deployment
kubectl get pods -o wide                       # show 3 pods
~~~

## Exposing a set of pods as a Service

Now that we have multiple pods, it would not be unreasonable to expect some form of traffic balancing across those so we utilize all resources.  This is done through a Kubernetes "Service".  A service can have assigned a type, depending on how public it is, ranging from: `ClusterIP` over `NodePort` to `LoadBalancer`.  A service selects its pods based on a selector, which queries the pod's labels and label values.

To create a service, create a file `mywebserver-service.yaml` with the following contents:

~~~yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
         name: myservice
         namespace: default
         labels:
             app: myapp
             tier: tier-label
spec:
         type: ClusterIP
         ports:
         - port: 80
         selector:
              app: myapp
~~~

Then create the service on the cluster:

~~~sh
kubectl create -f mywebserver-service.yaml  # create the svc
kubectl get svc                             # show the svc
kubectl describe svc                        # show which nodes/ip's it matches
~~~

Now with a `ClusterIP` type-of service, we can access this from within the cluster.  To do so, let's create a test-pod from where we can run the command.  We create a pod like this:

~~~yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myclient
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: client
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["infinity"]
~~~

To test connectivity with the `myservice` service:

~~~sh
kubectl exec -ti myclient /bin/bash
> apt-get update
> apt-get install curl
> curl myservice
> apt-get install dnsutils
> nslookup myservice
> exit
~~~

As a next step, let's modify the service and expose it publically using a load balancer:

~~~sh
kubectl edit svc myservice
# change the service type to "LoadBalancer"
kubectl get svc        # show how public ip is being provisioned
curl [public-ip-of-myservice]
~~~

## Persistent Storage

There is different ways in Azure to have containers persist data: Azure Disks or Azure Files.  We'll have a look at Azure files here.

In order to set up Azure Files with your cluster:

- make sure you have a pre-provisioned Azure Storage account in the same resource group and location as your cluster.  The Kubernetes auto-provisioning will later try to find this account automatically.
- create a `storageClass` for it first, in a file `azurefiles-storageclass.yaml`:

~~~yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: azurefile
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-file
mountOptions:
  - dir_mode=0777
  - file_mode=0777
  - uid=1000
  - gid=1000
parameters:
  skuName: Standard_LRS
~~~

~~~sh
kubectl create -f azurefiles-storageclass.yaml
~~~

Now that we have a storageClass, indicating that we have storage available of the kind "Azure Files", we need to "claim" dynamically chunks of this storage.  To do so, we're creating a so-called `Persistent Volume Claim`, reffering to our storage kind called `azurefile` in a file `mypvc.yaml`:

~~~yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
    name: mypvc
    labels:
        app: app-label
        tier: tier-label
spec:
    storageClassName: azurefile # standard or default
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
    resources:
        requests:
            # The amount of the volume's storage to request
            storage: 5Gi
~~~

~~~yaml
kubectl create -f mypvc.yaml
kubectl get pvc -o wide      # the pvc should show up as being "Bound"
~~~

Now that we have a claimed piece of storage, we can start using it within our pods.  Let's once more have nginx serve up some content; this time served from within Azure Files.
Adapt the previous deployment to something like the below:

~~~yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: mywebserverdeployment
    namespace: default
spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: myapp
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: myapp
                tier: data
        spec:
            volumes:
            - name: myvol
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: mypvc
            containers:
            - name: nginx
              image: nginx
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: 100m
                  memory: 200Mi
              ports:
              - containerPort: 80
              volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
                name: myvol
~~~

Redeploy the deployment.

> NGINX RETURNS A 403 FORBIDDEN - The reason is the permissions the folder is mounted with. The fix is in place but will only work with version 1.9.0+ of k8s.
